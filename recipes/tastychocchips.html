    <h3>The Best Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies </h3>
    <p>There are a few secrets to the best classic, chewy chocolate chip cookies. Number one: Don’t use chips; instead, opt for a mix of milk or semisweet and dark chocolate chunks. 
        The second is to let the dough rest overnight or longer for a more complex, toffee-like flavor. Lastly, use an ice cream scooper to get even-sized cookies every time. And 
        that’s it! With these little tweaks, the result is a cookie that’s textured on the outside, and soft and gooey on the inside. Absolutely perfect!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <h5>for 12 cookies</h5>
        <ul>
            
            <li>½ cup granulated sugar (100 g)</li>
            <li>¾ cup brown sugar (165 g), packed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter (115 g), melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour (155 g)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks (110 g)</li>
            <li>4 oz dark chocolate chunk (110 g), or your preference</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
            <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>            
        </ol>
